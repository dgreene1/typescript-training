# Requirements

* NodeJS
* NPM
* An IDE that supports TypeScript feedback:
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    * Provides built-in, first-class TypeScript support... and it's FREE! :)
  * Also okay, but not recommended is any other IDE. I hear that Webstorm/IntelliJ is decent though. However, atom and sublime have _okay_ plugins/extension for TypeScript. VSCode is preferred. 

# Setup

* run `npm install`
* take a quick look at the basic [TypeScript language features](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html).
  * You don't need to become a master through reading that ^ link. That's what this workshop is for! :)
* start with any file in the lessons folder and start by:
  * modify the file extension to be .ts
  * hover over the errors (one at a time) and follow the steps/guidelines in the comments
